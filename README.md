# AutoNUE2021_DomainAdaptationChallenge

This repository contains the datasets for Domain Adaptation challenge for AutoNEU 2021, CVPR Workshop. For more details, please visit https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/autonue2021/challenge.html


# Source datasets:
For the Cityscapes dataset, participants are requested to use the fine images (~3200 training samples). Refer: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/examples/#fine-annotations. For the other datasets (BDD, GTA and Mapillary), the list of image names are given in the csv files in the folder "Source".

Participants are requested to download the datasets from original websites, given below for easy reference:-
1. https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas?pKey=q0GhQpk20wJm1ba1mfwJmw
2. https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/ (you might have to click on Advanced tab, and then click on "proceed to bdd-data.berkeley.edu")
3. https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/

After downloading all the source datasets, download this repo, and move the source datasets in folder AutoNUE2021_DomainAdaptationChallenge/Source/:

cd AutoNUE2021_DomainAdaptationChallenge/Source/
chmod +x prep_all.sh
./prep_all.sh

This will create a folder "AutoNUE2021_DomainAdaptationChallenge/Source/source_datasets_dir/" where you will find the images and annotations for the source dataset to be used for this competetion.

# Target dataset:

   - The other part is IDD 20k II that was released in 2019.
   
   Extract both the downloaded compressed files in to the same folder.

For the Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation challenge, please use the datasets mentioned in previous section for the source. 
For the target dataset, we consider two sub-settings, one with 500 samples from IDD training set, and the other with 1000 samples from the same. Please refer to the csv files shared in Folder "Target_SemiSupervised".
